* byob, threads: metaprogramming support for c-slots with loop arrows (number: 15, spec: "ca", mnemonic: "loop")

### 2023-08-05
* threads: tweaked metaprogramming getter for "translations" block attribute selector to always return a list

### 2023-08-04

* threads: tweaked metaprogramming support for %scriptVars input slots

### 2023-08-03
* byob: made distancesMenu() available for custom blocks
* blocks, byob: renamed distancesMenu() into destinationsMenu()
* threads: fixed a type error when using metaprogramming to copy default inputs from a primitive over to a custom block definition
* threads: when querying the defintion of a block via metaprogramming make sure the number of inputs of the resulting ring matches that of the header expression
* byob, threads: tweaked some metaprogramming edge cases
* threads: fixed referencing system drop-down menus in metaprogramming

### 2023-08-02
* new dev branch and version
* blocks, byob: made %clr input slots available for custom blocks
* threads: metaprogramming support for color type input slots
* byob: made %scriptVars input slots available for custom blocks
* threads: metaprogramming support for %scriptVars input slots
